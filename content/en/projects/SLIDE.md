description: SLIDE is an online interactive platform designed to add interactivity to PowerPoint style presentations. While maintaining this project I improved bug reporting, media playback, and accessibility within the platform (in addition to many bug fixes). This platform hosts over 150 current lectures and sees thousands of active users every term. Some of the technologies used to construct the SLIDE platform include React, Redux, Typescript, AWS Lambda, AWS S3, AWS Codepipeline, and Nodejs.
