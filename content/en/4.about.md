A few words about me

#intro
Software Engineer and Web Developer with a passion for creating interactive multimedia applications. With expertise in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Vue.js, and AWS services, I build dynamic and responsive digital experiences that engage users and deliver value. My background in higher education has honed my ability to design, implement, and deliver innovative solutions that support and enhance learning initiatives.

Beyond my technical work, I am deeply passionate about digital art and music production. In my free time, I experiment with sound design in Ableton, drawing inspiration from artists like Aphex Twin and Autechre. I'm also an avid hiker and environmentalist, committed to sustainability and inspired by the natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest.

Explore my projects to see how I combine creativity and technical skills to build impactful digital experiences. Let's connect and create something amazing together!
